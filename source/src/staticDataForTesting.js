            'Crude oil erases early losses in a late rally to finish up 0.8% to $78.01 a barrel. Oil got its late strength from risk premium ahead of the weekend with worries over the Red Sea conflict, as well as better-than-expected economic figures issued in the U.S. this week. "Prices are still not high and certainly not high enough to stoke inflationary concerns at this stage," Craig Erlam of OANDA said in a note. The Federal Reserve will meet next week, which is expected to keep interest rates at their current levels or cut them. Brent crude closed up 1.4% to $83.55 a barrel.

            "Livestock futures settle higher with lean hogs and live cattle both advancing for the fourth day in a row. This week's export sales for beef and pork, coupled with the cold storage report, were supportive of prices, says Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at StoneX. USDA reported yesterday beef export sales of 22,400 metric tons for the week through Jan. 18, and pork export sales of 24,100 tons. The report \"was pretty good for beef and for pork as well. Not as strong as we've seen at times but still solid,\" Suderman says. The USDA also reported a decline in beef and pork in cold storage at the end of December, compared with a year earlier. Live cattle settles up 0.4% at $1.7845 a pound versus $1.74375 a week ago. Live hogs rise 0.8% to 83.25 cents a pound compared with 78.15 at the end of last week. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)",

            'High levels of wealth and a thick cushion of savings are likely to shield most Canadian households from financial difficulty fueled by higher debt payments, BMO Capital Markets writes in its week-ending note to clients. In an interview this week with WSJ, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said the pending wave of mortgage renewals, about C$700 billion worth, in 2024 and 2025 at higher rates would be "manageable" but "not easy." BMO says Canadians\' net worth is 31% above prepandemic levels, and it estimates households have parked C$180 billion in extra savings since the pandemic, which represents 12% of aftertax income. Still, BMO acknowledges debt levels are elevated, and that per-capita aftertax income, adjusted for inflation, has dropped 1.6% in the past year. (paul.vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)',

"Given WELL\'s increased focus on growing its Canadian clinics business, Intrahealth, which focuses on larger healthcare facilities, was becoming less core to its business," he says, and that the sale is "further evidence of WELL\'s focus on capital allocation, including business/asset divestitures."

            "ESG investing has emerged as a key differentiator among U.S. and European private-capital investors when it comes to fund structures, according to Probitas Partners' annual institutional investor survey. Speaking this week at the IPEM private-markets conference in Cannes, France, Managing Director Kelly DePonte said that 62% of European respondents cited the inclusion of a strong ESG or sustainability policy as a major issue of concern when negotiating fund structures. Overall only 28% of respondents cited that as a key target, down from 40% last year. The decline was driven by North American respondents, with 8% citing it as a key target, down from 23% last year, largely driven by political blowback, DePonte said. ESG interest in the U.S. had been increasing in previous years. (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)",

Worksport promised a swift market introduction and by ensuring the components so early, Worksport did its best to avoid delays in getting the SOLIS solar-powered cover and COR portable battery system to consumers. Moreover, under the agreement that Worksport made with Hyundai America Technical Center back in 2022, Worksport will also be supplying Hyundai with a prototype of the SOLIS cover, as well as a customized version of the COR battery system to fit the dimensions of the Hyundai Santa Cruz pickup. What makes Worksport’s groundbreaking power duo even more interesting is that besides the fact it will enhance the range of electric pickups and address the issue of range anxiety, the COR battery system is being designed to be used independently of pickups, bringing power off the grid and empowering its users to bring power on the go, and therefore being able to both reach and power remote locations. Therefore, with its revolutionary power accesories, Worksport promises to power and upgrade camping experiences, power remote work sites and bring ease to adventurous drivers so they don't worry about being stranded in the middle of nowhere.",

            'European shares rise after upbeat news from luxury goods and spirits companies. Luxury-goods houses advance after better-than-expected results from LVMH, which gains 12%, while spirits companies also rise as investors reacted positively to outlook comments by Remy Cointreau, whose shares advance 16%. The bounce in luxury and liquor stocks boosts the CAC 40 by more than 2%, while the Stoxx Europe 600 and FTSE 100 rally more than 1% and the DAX rises 0.3%. Brent crude drops 0.8% to $81.34 a barrel. The Dow also gains 0.3% after US December PCE year-on-year core inflation came in at 2.9%, below the 3% expected. "This adds to the steady accumulation of evidence that the Fed\'s job on inflation is mostly done," Evercore analysts say. (philip.waller@wsj.com)',

Wheat futures are down 3.1%, corn is down 1.1% and soybeans are off 0.5%. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)",
